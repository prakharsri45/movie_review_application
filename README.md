# movie_review_application
Develop a movie review application with a clear division between the client-side and server-side code. This separation of concerns allows the client and server components to progress separately using different technologies, ensuring they can develop independently and in parallel.

An application using MongoDb for the database, Java and Spring Boot for the backend, and React for the frontend.
